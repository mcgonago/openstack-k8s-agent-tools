# openstack-k8s-operators Operator Tools

Claude Code plugin for [openstack-k8s-operators](https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/) development — debugging, testing, code review, feature planning, and plan execution.

## Installation

### Claude Code (recommended)

Add the marketplace and install the plugin (two steps):

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add https://github.com/fmount/openstack-k8s-agent-tools
claude plugin install openstack-k8s-agent-tools
```

<!-- TODO: add manual install and OpenCode support when install.sh is ready -->

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Required | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| Go toolchain | Yes | Operator development, tests, linting |
| make | Yes | Build system (make test, make manifests, etc.) |
| gh (GitHub CLI) | Optional | Cross-repo analysis in `/plan-feature` when local checkouts aren't available |
| Atlassian MCP | Optional | Jira ticket reading in `/plan-feature` — configure in Claude Code settings |
| golangci-lint | Optional | Enhanced linting in `/test-operator` |
| gosec, govulncheck | Optional | Security scanning in `/test-operator security` |

## Skills

| Skill | Agent | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `/debug-operator` | — | Development workflow + runtime debugging |
| `/test-operator` | — | Testing & QA — quick, standard, full, security, coverage |
| `/code-style` | — | Go code style enforcement (gopls modernize, conventions) |
| `/analyze-logs` | — | Log pattern recognition (25+ patterns) |
| `/explain-flow` | — | Code flow analysis for controllers |
| `/plan-feature` | `plan-feature` | Feature/bug planning with Jira, cross-repo analysis, structured strategies |
| `/code-review` | `code-review` | Code review against openstack-k8s-operators conventions |
| `/task-executor` | `task-executor` | Execute plans task-by-task with checkpointing and resume |

Skills with an agent load an `AGENT.md` file that contains the full domain knowledge and methodology. Skills without an agent are self-contained in their `SKILL.md`.

## Quickstart

### Plan and implement a feature from a Jira ticket

```bash
cd ~/go/src/github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/heat-operator

# Plan from Jira (requires Atlassian MCP)
/plan-feature OSPRH-4567

# Or plan from a local spec file
/plan-feature docs/my-feature-spec.md
```

The skill fetches the ticket, analyzes your codebase and cross-references lib-common and peer operators, runs an 11-principle planning checklist, proposes implementation strategies, and produces a task breakdown. Then execute it:

```bash
/task-executor   # discovers plans for current operator automatically
```

See [docs/plan-feature.md](docs/plan-feature.md) for a full walkthrough.

### Development loop

```bash
# Fast feedback while coding
/test-operator quick

# Run focused tests
/test-operator focus "Checks the Topology"

# Check code style
/code-style
```

### Pre-PR validation

```bash
# Full test suite + linting + security
/test-operator full

# Review your changes
/code-review
```

### Debugging a deployed operator

```bash
# Systematic debugging workflow
/debug-operator nova-operator openstack

# Analyze collected logs
kubectl logs deployment/nova-operator -n openstack > nova.log
/analyze-logs nova.log
```

## Workflows

### Feature Development

```
/plan-feature OSPRH-2345 --> /task-executor --> /test-operator full --> /code-review --> PR
```

See [docs/plan-feature.md](docs/plan-feature.md) for detailed flow diagrams.

### Bug Fix

```
/analyze-logs --> /debug-operator --> /plan-feature OSPRH-XXX --> /task-executor --> /test-operator full --> PR
```

### Daily Development

```
write code --> /test-operator quick --> /test-operator focus "..." --> /code-style --> /code-review --> PR
```
