## Available Skills

### `/debug-operator`

Systematic operator debugging workflow:

- Pod status verification
- Log analysis for errors
- Custom resource inspection
- Event timeline review

### `/explain-flow`

Code flow analysis for operators:

- Controller reconciliation logic
- Decision tree mapping
- State transition diagrams
- Error handling paths

### `/feature`

Feature and bug fix planning with Jira integration:

- Fetch Jira tickets via Atlassian MCP (or use local spec files)
- Cross-repo analysis (lib-common, peer operators, dev-docs)
- Structured planning checklist (API, webhooks, conditions, tests, RBAC, etc.)
- 2-3 implementation strategies with trade-offs and recommendation
- Task breakdown grouped by functional area
- Plan files saved to `~/.local/share/openstack-k8s-agent-tools/plans/` per operator

### `/analyze-logs`

Intelligent log analysis:

- Error pattern recognition
- Performance issue detection
- Reconciliation behavior analysis
- Resource state tracking

### `/code-style`

Go code style enforcement:

- gopls modernize patterns
- openstack-k8s-operators operator conventions
- Controller-runtime best practices
- lib-common integration patterns

### `/test-operator`

Comprehensive testing and quality assurance:

- Multi-level testing workflows (quick/standard/full)
- Ginkgo focused testing support
- golangci-lint and operator-lint integration
- Security scanning (gosec, govulncheck)
- Test coverage analysis and reporting
- Auto-fix common issues

### `/code-review`

Code review agent for openstack-k8s-operators:

- Reconciliation patterns (finalizers, deferred status, return-after-update)
- Status conditions (severity/reason rules, ObservedGeneration)
- Webhook conventions (Spec-level Default/Validate, field paths)
- API design (override patterns, probes, topology/affinity)
- Testing (EnvTest, TestVector pattern, simulated dependencies)
- RBAC marker verification
- Structured review output with severity and verdict

### `/backport-review`

Structured backport review for downstream change requests:

- Validates OSPRH Jira ticket presence in description
- Validates each commit has `Upstream-<release>: url` in description, or `[downstream-only]` tag with description entry
- Resolves upstream patches via Gerrit REST API (review.opendev.org)
- Selects oldest upstream branch by default; accepts an optional branch name or release codename (e.g. `Flamingo`) to compare against a specific branch instead
- Fetches and compares downstream vs upstream `.patch` files
- Classifies differences as EXPECTED / NOTABLE / CONCERN
- Always highlights downstream-only commits in summary

### `/task-executor`

Execute implementation plans task-by-task:

- Load and resume plan files from `~/.local/share/openstack-k8s-agent-tools/plans/`
- Sequential task execution with checkpointing
- Code quality enforcement (gopls modernize, lib-common, conventions)
- Test-first for new reconciliation paths
- Group boundary review gates

## MCP Integrations

### Atlassian MCP (Optional)

The `/feature` skill integrates with Atlassian MCP for Jira ticket reading. When configured, you can invoke `/feature OSPRH-2345` to fetch and plan from a Jira ticket directly. Without it, the skill works with local spec files or pasted content.

Configure the Atlassian MCP server in your Claude Code settings to enable this integration.

## Development Guidelines

### When working with openstack-k8s-operators operators

1. **Always start with systematic diagnosis** using `/debug-operator`
2. **Use TodoWrite** for complex tasks to track progress
3. **Follow development workflow** with make targets and testing
4. **Analyze logs methodically** with `/analyze-logs` for patterns
5. **Document code flow** when explaining complex controller logic
6. **Plan features carefully** using `/feature` for new implementations
7. **Enforce code style** using `/code-style` for consistency and best practices

### Testing Commands

```bash
# Check dependencies and KUBECONFIG
./scripts/install.sh --check

# Test development workflow (in operator directory)
cd /path/to/operator
./lib/dev-workflow.sh run_full_workflow
./lib/dev-workflow.sh focus_test "Checks the Topology"

# Test code style analysis
python3 ./lib/style-analyzer.py controllers/controller.go

# Test in Claude Code
claude
/debug-operator
/code-style

# Run tests (if available)
npm test

# Lint and format
npm run lint
npm run format

# Build plugin
npm run build
```

### Installation Commands

```bash
# Install locally
./scripts/install.sh

# Install for Claude Code
/plugin install openstack-k8s-agent-tools

# Install for OpenCode (when available)
./scripts/install.sh --opencode
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always verify pod status first** before diving into logs
2. **Use grep patterns** to focus on relevant log entries
3. **Check custom resource conditions** for operator state
4. **Review Kubernetes events** for cluster-level issues
5. **Follow reconciliation patterns** when analyzing controller logic
6. **Document complex flows** with diagrams and step-by-step explanations
